# Emergency-Vechile-Detection-Competition-
Rank 6 using FastAI 

The notebook attached details my approach to the Emergency Vehicle Detection competition on Analytics Vidya . The task at hand was to classify emergency vechiles and non emergency vechiles 

I Used fastAI for this competition.FastAI is built on top of pytorch and provided powerful methods for classification task with very few lines of code. 
My winning solution I used Resnet34 with batch size of 16. I tried various model and Batch size and transformation but decided to stick with low weight model as the training data I had was limited.
